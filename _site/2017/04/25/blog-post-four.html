<p>Using the comments for the hiphop section for Reddit, we wanted to take each of the comments url by artist and run a sentiment analysis on each group of strings. Then, cross referencing that with Spotify data, we would use this sentiment analysis as a predictor to try and find how good of predictors these comments can be for the popularity of the song using the similar method we did for genre. This helps us achieve the implementation that we were looking for of different sources for metrics for trying to determine popularity. The next step from here would be to combine different features together with our popularity predictors (such as genre, length of the song, mentions on twitter, popularity of the artist) to find the best set of predictors that we can to see what makes certain songs popular and what certain groups of songs might be outliers to this model.</p>

By analyzing the frequency of occurrences of artist names in post titles, we
were able to filter down the number of artists that we were to look at. Above is
a graph of the most frequent artists in r/hiphopheads posts.
</p>

<p>
  An early look into the comments shows that certain threads have a positive
  tone while others are very negative. For example, the post
  "Kodak Black says Lil Wayne can 'Eat His Ass'" has many expletives while
  the post "Migos' 'Bad and Boujee,' Featuring Lil Uzi Vert, Tops Hot 100" has
  a more excited and positive tone. We believe that further sentiment analysis will
  give us an understanding of how positively and negatively different musicians
  and songs are received, and understand what types of popularity different
  artists attain.

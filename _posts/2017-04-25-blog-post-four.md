================
Using the comments for the hiphop section for Reddit, we wanted to take each of the comments url by artist and run a sentiment analysis on each group of strings. Then, cross referencing that with Spotify data, we would use this sentiment analysis as a predictor to try and find how good of predictors these comments can be for the popularity of the song using the similar method we did for genre. This helps us achieve the implementation that we were looking for of different sources for metrics for trying to determine popularity. The next step from here would be to combine different features together with our popularity predictors (such as genre, length of the song, mentions on twitter, popularity of the artist) to find the best set of predictors that we can to see what makes certain songs popular and what certain groups of songs might be outliers to this model.

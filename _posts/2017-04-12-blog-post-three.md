A goal of our project was to analyzing how social media and music are related in
the modern age.
To do so, we collected social media data from the subreddit (forum) r/hiphopheads.
This is a community dedicated to "the latest mixtapes, videos, news, and anything else hip hop related from your favorite artists." With over 500,000 members and several years of
activity, we thought it would be good to look into the trends within this hip hop
centered community.

By scraping the Internet Archive, we were able to see the most popular posts 
from hundreds of days since 2012. Each post has a title and a comment thread
linked to it. We thought it would be a good start to analyze the titles of
the posts as they often mention artists, songs or albums. For example, this
post from 1-22-2017 mentions the artists Big Sean and Kanye West.

    "title": "Big Sean Recalls His First Trip to SNL with Kanye West",
    "comments_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/5pam64/big_sean_recalls_his_first_trip_to_snl_with_kanye/",
    "date": "20170122045016"

In our first analysis, we found that suprisingly Kendrick Lamar has been
mentioned the most by far in the posts in 2017. Kendrick has only been on the
Billboard charts this year for two weeks yet 34 posts mention Kendrick
while other artists more popular on the charts like Migos and Kodak Black have
generally been mentioned around 10-15 times.

Just last week Kendrick Lamar released the single "Humble" from his new album
DAMN and news about a possible new album blew up around 3/24. Since then, there
have been many updates about Kendrick and his new album.

In addition, Kendrick Lamar can be found on the oldest archives in 2012, when
his hit album "Good Kid, M.A.A.D City" was released. This shows us that Kendrick Lamar
is much more influential to the hip hop community than what the Billboard
charts show us.

While other artists rise to and fall from fame quickly as music trends change,
certain artists like Kanye West, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar continue to stay relevant
for years. Our findings lead us to think that the popularity of these artists
on social media even when they are not releasing songs may be a better indicator
of how well future albums sell and are received than chart ratings. For example,
Kanye West has been mentioned 13 times this year, mostly in posts about his
health and interviews.


In our next updates we will see how well machine learning and statistics back up
our conclusion.
